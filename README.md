# Cards calisthenics workout app
This is a calisthenics workout app based on using the standard 52 cards in a deck for exercise selection.
Built with Vue.js and Bootstrap.

## Motivation
I built the original version of this app in 2020 while I was at home from school. I found a workout program that was based on a card deck and wrote an original version of this app for myself based on that program to work out with in Vanilla JS. This version of the program was meant for me to be able to correct some of the mistakes that I made in the original implementation and to learn VueJs.
